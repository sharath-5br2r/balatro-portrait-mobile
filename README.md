## Changes
- **Reduced External Dependencies:** No need of `aapt2` and `apktool` and is replaced with `APKEditor`. Automatic `java` downloads are removed, thus running on any OS that supports `java` and `python`
- **Custom Keystore** support

## Features

- **Portrait mode** with a vertical layout rebuilt for one-handed play
- **Touch controls** with anti-jitter, so a shaky tap does not turn into a drag
- **Swipe gestures**: flick a selected card up to play it, down to discard
- **Hand preview**: a floating chip shows the current poker hand (name, level, chips x mult)
- **Redesigned HUD** with thumb-sized targets
- **High refresh rate** matched to your display (90/120 Hz)
- **Diagnostics screen** (Options -> Diagnostics) with a copyable device/layout
  report that drops straight into bug reports
- **Mods** through [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), with optional one-command Steamodded install
- **Save transfer** from desktop Balatro or the official Play app, no root needed(only in legit installs).
- **Termux builds** with no PC, using the installed Play Store app as the source
- **Zygisk module** (experimental, root only) for the official Google Play install
- **iOS** (experimental) sideloadable `.ipa`

## Which build should I use?

If you are not sure, use the rootless APK builder. It does not need root.

| Path | Best for | Root | What you install |
|------|----------|------|------------------|
| **Rootless APK builder** also possible on Termux on device| Most users | No | A separate `com.unofficial.balatro` portrait APK |
| **Zygisk module** | Rooted users keeping the official app | Yes | `balatro_portrait.zip` from Releases |
| **iOS** | Testers | No jailbreak | Experimental `.ipa` |

Ready-made rootless APKs are not uploaded here because they contain your own
Balatro files. The Zygisk ZIP only holds the portrait module, so it can live on
the Releases page.

Every path needs a copy of Balatro.;
phone-only builds need Termux (F-Droid or GitHub build).


## Rootless APK builder

Build a portrait APK on Windows, macOS, Termux,or Linux:

### Phone build (Termux, no PC) Prerequisites

If the official Play Store Balatro is installed, Termux can build the portrait
APK straight from it. No PC copy of `Balatro.exe` or `Game.love` is needed.

1. Install the official Play Store Balatro and launch it once.
2. Install Termux from F-Droid or GitHub.
3. In Termux run `termux-setup-storage`, tap **Allow**, then paste to install dependencies:

```sh
pkg update -y && pkg install -y git python openjdk-21 
```

4. Then proceed below

### PC Prerequisites
You need to install `openjdk`(17+) and `python`(3.6+). Optionally `git` can be used for cloning.

>[!Note]
> For Advanced Users Only
>
> For a custom keystore, copy it to balatro-portrait-mobile after cloning as ks.keystore.
>
> Set the variables as KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KEYSTORE_ALIAS and KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD(if different).
>
>```sh
>cp /path/to/keystore ks.keystore
>export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=password # use set in cmd.exe instead
>export KEYSTORE_ALIAS=alias
>```


```sh
rm -rf balatro-portrait-mobile
git clone https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile.git
cd balatro-portrait-mobile
python build.py
```

The first run asks where Balatro is installed and extracts what it needs. The
APK is written to:

```text
balatro-mobile-maker/balatro-aligned-debugSigned.apk
```

when debug keystore is used or

```text
balatro-mobile-maker/balatro-aligned-signed.apk
```

when custom keystore is used.

Install it using `adb install /path/to/balatro.apk` or `termux-open /path/to/balatro.apk`(Requires Termux API) or copying manually.

Common options:

```sh
python build.py --keep-crt --readabletro
python build.py --steamodded                       # bundle Steamodded (newest)
python build.py --import-save "%APPDATA%\Balatro"   # bring your save across
python build.py --balatro "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro\Balatro.exe" --force
```

## Zygisk module (experimental, root only)

This keeps the official Google Play app installed and injects portrait mode at
launch. It does not patch or re-sign the APK, but it needs root + Zygisk and is
arm64 only. It does not provide Lovely mods; that is the rootless build's job.

1. Install the official Play Store Balatro and launch it once.
2. Download `balatro_portrait.zip` from GitHub Releases.
3. Flash the ZIP from KernelSU, Magisk, or APatch.
4. Pick Readabletro/CRT options during install.
5. Reboot and launch the official Balatro app.

More details: [zygisk/README.md](zygisk/README.md).

## iOS (experimental, testers wanted)

Build with `--ios`, then sideload `balatro-portrait.ipa` with
[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or [AltStore](https://altstore.io/). Full
guide: [docs/IOS.md](docs/IOS.md).

The notch / Dynamic Island inset (v2.6.4) and the home-indicator inset
(v2.7.0) are read from the device at runtime, but this project is developed
without an iPhone, so none of it is verified on real hardware. If the layout
still looks off on yours, `src/portrait_config.lua` has two knobs:
`safe_area_extra_ios` (more gap under the island) and
`safe_area_bottom_extra_ios` (more gap above the swipe bar).

**Testing takes five minutes and helps a lot.** [Open an issue](https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile/issues)
with:

- your device model and iOS version
- a screenshot of the title screen and one mid-run
- anything clipped, overlapped, or unreachable

## Mods

The Android build ships with Lovely, so it can run mods. Most mods need
Steamodded, and the build can fetch and bundle it for you:

```sh
python build.py --steamodded          # newest Steamodded
python build.py --steamodded <tag>    # a specific release
```

A bundled mod installs itself on the first launch. Restart the game once and it
is active.

To add other mods by hand, put each one in the app's `Mods/` folder:

1. Launch the game once, then close it.
2. Install [Material Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files).
3. Menu -> **Add storage** -> **External storage** -> pick the **Balatro** app
   -> **Use this folder**.
4. Put the mod folder in `game/Mods/`, then restart.

Root and ADB work too. See [docs/MODDING.md](docs/MODDING.md).

## Save transfer

Carry your unlocks and progression into the portrait app from desktop Balatro or
the official Play Store app (via Google Takeout, no root). The build can bake a
save in, so it is there on first launch:

```sh
python build.py --import-save "%APPDATA%\Balatro"        # desktop save folder
python build.py --import-save takeout-XXXXXXXX-001.zip   # official-app export
```

Full walkthrough, including the manual copy route: [docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md](docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md).

## Troubleshooting

**Game will not start.** Make sure the first-run extraction finished;
`src/resources/` and `src/localization/` must exist. Re-run `python build.py`.

**Build fails.** Check `python --version` (3.6+ required). The JDK and build
tools download automatically on the first build (about 250 MB), so you need an
internet connection.

**Black ellipse or colored sliver at the bottom.** The CRT shader can cause this
in portrait on some devices. Rebuild with `python build.py --disable-crt`, or
answer **yes** to "Disable the CRT shader?" in the interactive build.

**Something looks misplaced or cut off.** Open **Options -> Diagnostics** in
game, tap **Copy to clipboard**, and paste the report into your issue — it
carries the exact screen and safe-area numbers of your device.

Path-specific problems are covered in their own guides:
[Zygisk](zygisk/README.md) · [iOS](docs/IOS.md) ·
[Modding](docs/MODDING.md) · [Save transfer](docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md)
